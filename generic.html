						<p>Acedemic Writings During My Undergradate Degree</p>
					</header>
					<p>During the last year of my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto I underwent writing two final projects that displayed my skills and knowledge in both Physics and Environmental Science. These two projects pushed me to learn in new ways unconventional to the typical university experience. By researching and conducting my own scientific approaches to these projects I was able to grow as a student and as an individual.  </p>

								<h3>Radiation Sources, Levels and Radiation Hormesis</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Wagih Ghobriel (Department of Chemical and Physical Sciences) I was given the opportunity to write a paper on the physical nature of radiation and the controversial topic of radiation hormesis; which suggests low levels of radiation exposure in humans is beneficial. The report was presented infront of faculty at the university and received a final grade of 90%. </p>

								<h3>Do Invasive Earthworms Negatively Impact Salamander Abundance Along the
								Credit River Forest?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Christoph Richter ( Department of Biology) and Dr. Monika Havelka (Department of Geography), a team of four students including myself embarked on writing an academic paper studing the relationship between the native salamander species Plethodon cinereus and the invasive earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris. The paper was constructed after gathering four months of field research data around the University of Toronto Mississauga campus and received a final grade of 90%.</p>
